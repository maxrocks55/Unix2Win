# Unix2Win
a in the works header library designed to import to originally linux/macOS/Unix c++ projects to make the commands, but run **windows** code.
---
**This is not a perfect solution, and will not work for all unix c++ projects, but it should be enough to port basic projects from linux/MacOS/Unix to win32 c++**
---
*i included an uncompiled c++ script which utilizes the header, please note that you must have the header in the same folder as the uncompiled c script for it to read properly.*
